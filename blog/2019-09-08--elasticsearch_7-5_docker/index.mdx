Let's run a __Elasticsearch 7.5__ as a single node cluster using Docker Compose with XPack disabled. To run the Elasticsearch 7 Docker image as a single node, you have to set `discovery.type` to `single-node`. At startup, the bootstrap checks are bypassed. The single node will elect itself as the master node and will not join a cluster with any other node.


A complete docker-compose.yml example to run a single node Elasticsearch 7 Cluster including Kibana:


```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:

  # Elasticsearch Docker Images: https://www.docker.elastic.co/
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.5.0
    container_name: elasticsearch
    environment:
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
      - discovery.type=single-node
    ulimits:
      memlock:
        soft: -1
        hard: -1
      nofile:
        soft: 65536
        hard: 65536
    cap_add:
      - IPC_LOCK
    volumes:
      - elasticsearch-data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
      - 9300:9300

  kibana:
    container_name: kibana
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:7.5.0
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
    ports:
      - 5601:5601
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch

volumes:
  elasticsearch-data:
    driver: local
```



Start Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker Compose:


```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


Your Elasticsearch node will startup now, and after a couple of seconds, you can reach it at `http://localhost:9200/`. Kibana should be running at `http://localhost:5601` now. To shut down Elasticsearch and Kibana run:


```bash
docker-compose down
```


In case you also would like to remove the docker volume while shutting down run:


```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
