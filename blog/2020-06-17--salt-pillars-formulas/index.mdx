## Working with Pillars

Pillars in Salt is arbitrary, minion-specific data. There is a large volume of [Pillar Modules](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/master/ref/pillar/all/index.html) available to pull this data into Salt from external sources.


Instructions on how to pull this data in is stored in `*.sls` files. Start by creating the directory `/srv/pillar` and add the following files:


__top.sls__

```yaml
base:
  '*':
    - name
```

The `Top File` sets the permission - what minions have access to a specific file. In this case all minions will have access to the file `name.sls`:


__name.sls__

```yaml
{% if grains.os == 'Ubuntu' %}
name: Ubuntu Rocks
{% elif grains.os == 'Centos' %}
name: CentOS Rocks
{% endif %}
```

We can clean this up by using a dictionary:

```yaml
{% set lookup = {
  'Ubuntu': 'Ubuntu Rocks',
  'Centos': 'Centos Rocks'
} %}

{% set name = lookup[grains.os] %}

name: {{ name | json() }}
```

Or:

```yaml
{% set os = salt.grains.filter_by({
    'Ubuntu': {
        'name': 'Ubuntu Rocks'
    },
    'Centos': {
        'name': 'Centos Rocks'
    }
}) %}

name: {{ os.name }}
```


Run the following command to update all minions:


```bash
sudo salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar

ubuntuAsus:
    True
```


We can use this data for example in our Apache landing page (see previous tutorial):


__welcome.sls__

```yaml
# Adding a blank front page
{% set name = salt.pillar.get('name') %}

check_pillar_values:
  test.check_pillar:
    - present:
      - name
    - failhard: True

welcome_page:
  file.managed:
    - name: /var/www/html/index.html
    - contents: |
        <!doctype html>
        <body>
            <h1>{{ name }}.</h1>
        </body>
```


You should be able to see that you Minions have access to your pillars:


```bash
sudo salt '*' pillar.items
```


And check that your front page was updated:


```bash
sudo salt '*' state.sls apache.welcome
```


You can also manually set the value of `name` - but this data will be send to all minions and is NOT PRIVATE:


```bash
sudo salt '*' state.sls apache.welcome pillar='{name: Override}'
```


## Working with Formulas

[Formulas are pre-written Salt States](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html). They are as open-ended as Salt States themselves and can be used for tasks such as installing a package, configuring, and starting a service, setting up users or permissions, and many other common tasks.

All official Salt Formulas are found as separate Git repositories in the ["saltstack-formulas" organization on GitHub](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas). They can be downloaded using the [GIT Fileserver Backend](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/master/ref/file_server/all/salt.fileserver.gitfs.html#module-salt.fileserver.gitfs). To be able to use Git you first have to uncomment it in your `/etc/salt/master` config. Or use a `local.conf` in `/etc/salt/master.d/local.conf`:


```yaml
fileserver_backend:
  - git
  - roots

gitfs_remotes:
  - https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/memcached-formula
```

After adding your [desired Formulas](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas) restart the Salt master and use the `cp.list_master` or `cp.list_states` command to get a list of all available configuration files to make sure that `memcached` was successfully cloned from Github:


```bash
sudo systemctl restart salt-master

sudo salt ubuntuAsus cp.list_states
ubuntuAsus:
    - apache
    - apache.map
    - apache.mods
    - apache.welcome
    - memcached
    - memcached.config
    - memcached.libmemcached
    - memcached.macros
    - memcached.python_memcached
    - memcached.uninstall
```




Continue installing the following package: 


__on CentOS__

```
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install GitPython
```


__on Ubuntu__


```
sudo apt install python-git-doc
```
