Currently there is no minimal Image of CentOS available yet - so start by [downloading the full image](https://centos.org/download/) and select the minimal install from the installer.


## Docker ?

The first thing I noticed was that I was unable to install Docker-CE without running into [Error messages](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-rhel-8-centos-8/). And then I saw that Docker has been replaced with [buildah](https://blog.centos.org/2019/02/using-buildah-to-build-container-images-on-centos/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/getting-started). Alright, I heard about Podman before and it was supposed to be really. So why not give it a try.


```bash
[root@localhost]# buildah version

Go Version:      go1.11.5
Image Spec:      1.0.0

```


### buildah

[buildah](https://buildah.io) is a command line tool that facilitates building [OCI compliant images](https://www.opencontainers.org/). There's a plethora of information available around what buildah is on its [GitHub landing page](https://github.com/containers/buildah/). It is worth mentioning that buildah helps you build container images without having to run any daemon in the background, unlike the docker CLI tool which requires the Docker daemon to be running in the background.


The buildah images command will list all the images:


```bash
buildah images
```


We can also see that there are also no containers by running:


```bash
buildah containers
```


#### Using Dockerfiles with Buildah

What if you have been using Docker for a while and have some existing Dockerfiles. Not a problem. Buildah can build images using a Dockerfile. The `build-using-dockerfile`, or `bud` for short, takes a Dockerfile as input and produces an OCI image.

I am going to use an [existing Dockerfiles](https://github.com/mpolinowski/material-ui-gatsby-wiki) that uses the Node.js baseimage to host a static website:


```dockerfile
FROM        node:latest
MAINTAINER  Mike Polinowski
ENV         NODE_ENV=production
ENV         PORT=7777
COPY        ./deploy /app
WORKDIR     /app
RUN         npm install
EXPOSE      7777
ENTRYPOINT  ["npm", "start"]
```


This file copies the source code - an Express.js web application - from a folder _deploy_ in the same directory as the _Dockerfile_ into the container and runs the Node.js command `npm install` to install all app dependencies. The command `npm start` is executed once the container is run and starts the web content hosting service on port `7777` that is then exposed to become accessible for us.


Now run buildah bud with the name of the Dockerfile and the name to be given to the created image (e.g. mui-gatsby-markdown):


```bash
buildah bud -f Dockerfile -t mui-gatsby-markdown .
```





### Podman

[Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod) is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode.





[docker-compose](https://github.com/containers/libpod#out-of-scope): We believe that Kubernetes is the defacto standard for composing Pods and for orchestrating containers, making Kubernetes YAML a defacto standard file format. Hence, Podman allows the creation and execution of Pods from a Kubernetes YAML file (see [podman-play-kube](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/docs/podman-play-kube.1.md)). Podman can also generate Kubernetes YAML based on a container or Pod (see p[odman-generate-kube](https://github.com/containers/libpod/blob/master/docs/podman-generate-kube.1.md)), which allows for an easy transition from a local development environment to a production Kubernetes cluster. If Kubernetes does not fit your requirements, there are other third-party tools that support the docker-compose format such as [kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose/) and [podman-compose](https://github.com/muayyad-alsadi/podman-compose) that might be appropriate for your environment.
