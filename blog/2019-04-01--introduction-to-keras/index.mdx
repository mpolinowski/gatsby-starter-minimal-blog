[Keras](https://keras.io) is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. 


## Installation of Keras

You can install TensorFlow directly through `pip3 install keras` (make sure you have [Python v3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed).

I have [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) set up on my computer and am going to use it for this instead. If you already have Anaconda installed, make sure that it is up to date (make sure that you start the [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal) with Admin privileges):


```bash
conda update conda
conda update anaconda
```


Anaconda allows us to create a virtual environment in which we can run our TensorFlow and Keras program. To create the environment with the name `py3-TF2` run the following command in the Anaconda Prompt - hit `y` when prompted:


```bash
conda create --name py3-TF2 python=3
conda activate py3-TF2
```


Before installing Keras, please install one of its backend engines: [TensorFlow](https://mpolinowski.github.io/introduction-to-tensorflow-2-beta), Theano, or CNTK. We recommend the TensorFlow backend. We can now continue installing Keras inside this virtual environment:


```bash
pip install keras
```


To be able to use the virtual environment in [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook) we need to install `ipykernel` and `nb_conda_kernels` inside it:


```bash
pip install ipykernel
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```
