In order for [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) to work on the system ,`zsh` need to be installed.


## Install ZSH


```bash
sudo yum update && sudo yum -y install zsh
```


## Make it as Default Shell


```bash
chsh -s (which zsh) root
```

### If chsh not found


```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh root
-bash: chsh: command not found
```

```bash
yum install util-linux-user
```


### Verify

Logout from the root user and login again to verify the shell


```bash
[root@CentOS8 ~]# su
[root@CentOS8]~# echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```


## Install Oh-My-Zsh Framework

Once Z Shell is installed and confirmed install the Framework from the GIT


```bash
yum install wget git
wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh
```


Oh-My-Zsh will be installed in the home directory `~/.oh-my-zsh`.Copy the zshrc.zsh-template config file to the home directory .zshrc and apply the config:


```bash
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```


### Change Oh-My-Zsh Themes


Oh-My-Zsh framework [provides large number of themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes). You can change the default themes by editing the config file .zshrc which will be under `./oh-my-zsh/themes/`

Set ZSH_THEME to the name of the theme in your ~/.zshrc and run `su` to activate it:


```bash
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"

...
```


### Install external Themes

see [external Themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes).

__Example__: [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#oh-my-zsh)


```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Set `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `~/.zshrc`.


```bash
su
```
