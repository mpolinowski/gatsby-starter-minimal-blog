## Instruments


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_01.jpg.png)


### Fuel

A lamp is lit it means that a particular tank is empty.


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_02.jpg.png)


The meanings of the lamps:

* __I__ - outer two external tanks;
* __II__ - inner two external tanks;
* __КР__ - wing tanks;
* __3/4__ - third and fourth tanks;
* __Ц__ - central fuselage tank;
* __0.5__ - emeregency fuel quantity - equal or less 500 kilogramms.


### Warning Lamps

I've noticed only 4 warning lamps work in the Su-25T


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_03.jpg)


1. `Смотри таьло` -General warning lamp, indicates either stall speed, pull up, low air-speed, and along with most any other warning lamp.
2. `Пожар` - Engine failure/fire (_Currently it can be any engine_)


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_04.jpg)


* Engine 1 controls hydraulics 1
* Engine 2 controls hydraulics 2


3. `гидро1` - hydraulics failure 1 (Hydro 1 controls the nosewheel steering unit, the initial chambers of the aileron boosters, the airbrakes, the slats, the flaps and the elevators (_Rudders are not controlled by hydraulic system_)
4. `гидро2` - hydraulics failure 2 (Hydro 2 controls the undercarriage extension and retraction, mainwheel braking, the yaw damper, and the second chambers of the aileron boosters)

* Looking at the engine temperatures also can show indication of a fire if the temperature is in the red zone, when engine is on fire you should turn it off or it will cause fuel tanks to explode.

### Hydraulics

(_Same stuff explained above, with addition to brakes and tips_)


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_05.jpg)


1. Nosewheel braking
2. Mainwheel brake
3. Hydro 1 controls the nosewheel steering unit, the initial chambers of the aileron boosters, the airbrakes, the slats, the flaps and the elevators (_Rudders are not controlled by hydraulic system_)
4. Hydro 2 controls the undercarriage extension and retraction, mainwheel braking, the yaw damper, and the second chambers of the aileron boosters

* If a hydraulic leak occurs and is of risk falling below 50%, it is best to lower the gears, otherwise they will not lower fully
* Airbreaks also should be closed quickly if a leak occurs or they will stay open once fluid leaks completely
* Flaps are not as important as landing than gear, and they also relly on the hydraulic fluid. Gears are more of a priority than flaps
* Functions of hydraulics do not function properly below 50%

### Threat Types


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_06.png)


* __П__ = airborne radar

* __3__ = long range radar

* __X__ = medium range radar

* __H__ = short range radar

* __F__ = early warning radar

* __C__ = AWACS



### RTB


1. Hit `1` on your keyboard until you are in __RTN__ mode.
2. Align your __HSI__.
3. Center your __ADI__.
4. Keep your Heading Indicator inside the __Circle__ in your __HUD__.


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_09.png)


## Airport/Airfield/Aerodrome IDs

These IDs are used with the navigation system built into the HUD of the Su-25T, when in navigation mode (pressing __1__ for Route mode (`MPW` or `ENR`), Airfield beacon mode (`B3B` or `RTN`), and Landing mode (`ПОС` or `LNDC`) , pressing __Ctrl+`__ will cycle through the waypoints/ID's of Airfields in __Return Navigation Mode__ and in __Landing Mode__.

## HARM Ground Radar Signatures

When equipped with __Fantasmagoria__ pod , going into ground attack mode (__7__) then activate the pod with (__I__) and Radar targets will appear on your HUD. Some have designations to identify them with.

## Su-25T Pylons

The modeling of lateral and longitudinal center of mass is taken into effect. This can
change depending on fuel load and weapon loads.

The asymmetrical loading of weapon and fuel pylons, which influence the characteristics of
lateral control (depending on flight speed, regular overload, etc), is also modeled.
