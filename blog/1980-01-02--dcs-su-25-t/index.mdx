## Su-25T Basic Info

The information in this guide is subject to change if future updates modify/add anything.

Mission Role Tasks :
* AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) : An airborne radar
* CAP (Combat Air Patrol) : Protect friendly assets in and around the station area
* SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) : Engage SAM radar and launch vehicles.
* CAS (Close Air Support) : Destroy as many vehicles as possible
* Sweep : Aggressive counter air into enemy territory
* Intercept : Air to Air interception of an assigned aircraft
* Escort : Protect a target
* OCA (Offensive Counter Air) Engage dangerous enemy assets such like SAM launch vehicles and airbases
* Strike : Standard Air to Ground mission against enemy war production
* Deep Strike : Strike deep into enemy territory
* FAC (Forward Air Control) : Assign targets
* Recon (Reconnaissance) : Gather intelligence of enemy area


## Instruments


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_01.jpg)


### Fuel

A lamp is lit it means that a particular tank is empty.


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_02.jpg)


The meanings of the lamps:

* __I__ - outer two external tanks;
* __II__ - inner two external tanks;
* __КР__ - wing tanks;
* __3/4__ - third and fourth tanks;
* __Ц__ - central fuselage tank;
* __0.5__ - emeregency fuel quantity - equal or less 500 kilogramms.


### Warning Lamps

I've noticed only 4 warning lamps work in the Su-25T


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_03.jpg)


1. `Смотри таьло` -General warning lamp, indicates either stall speed, pull up, low air-speed, and along with most any other warning lamp.
2. `Пожар` - Engine failure/fire (_Currently it can be any engine_)


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_04.jpg)


* Engine 1 controls hydraulics 1
* Engine 2 controls hydraulics 2


3. `гидро1` - hydraulics failure 1 (Hydro 1 controls the nosewheel steering unit, the initial chambers of the aileron boosters, the airbrakes, the slats, the flaps and the elevators (_Rudders are not controlled by hydraulic system_)
4. `гидро2` - hydraulics failure 2 (Hydro 2 controls the undercarriage extension and retraction, mainwheel braking, the yaw damper, and the second chambers of the aileron boosters)

* Looking at the engine temperatures also can show indication of a fire if the temperature is in the red zone, when engine is on fire you should turn it off or it will cause fuel tanks to explode.

### Hydraulics

(_Same stuff explained above, with addition to brakes and tips_)


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_05.jpg)


1. Nosewheel braking
2. Mainwheel brake
3. Hydro 1 controls the nosewheel steering unit, the initial chambers of the aileron boosters, the airbrakes, the slats, the flaps and the elevators (_Rudders are not controlled by hydraulic system_)
4. Hydro 2 controls the undercarriage extension and retraction, mainwheel braking, the yaw damper, and the second chambers of the aileron boosters

* If a hydraulic leak occurs and is of risk falling below 50%, it is best to lower the gears, otherwise they will not lower fully
* Airbreaks also should be closed quickly if a leak occurs or they will stay open once fluid leaks completely
* Flaps are not as important as landing than gear, and they also relly on the hydraulic fluid. Gears are more of a priority than flaps
* Functions of hydraulics do not function properly below 50%

### Threat Types


![SU-25T Instruments](./Frogfoot_Instruments_06.png)


* __П__ = airborne radar

* __3__ = long range radar

* __X__ = medium range radar

* __H__ = short range radar

* __F__ = early warning radar

* __C__ = AWACS


## Airport/Airfield/Aerodrome IDs

_This is useful if you are not looking at a map or need more precise way of figuring out an airfield besides looking for the closest one._

These IDs are used with the navigation system built into the HUD of the Su-25T, when in navigation mode (pressing 1 for Route mode (`MPW` or `ENR`), Airfield beacon mode (`B3B` or `RTN`), and Landing mode (`ПОС` or `LNDC`) , pressing `Ctrl+` will cycle through the waypoints/ID's of Airfields in "Airfield beacon mode" and also the landing glidescopes of airfields in __Landing mode__.

## Ground Radar signitures

When equiped with Fantasmagoria pod , going into ground attack mode (__7__) then activate the pod with (__I__) and Radar targets will appear on your hud. Some have designations to identify them with.

## How to shoot multiple Vikhr missiles

1. Set launch mode to 2 rocket launch (hit Cntrl+V so that the missile launch circle is in the center of your hud, not the side.)
2. Press trigger for one missile to launch, hold for two to launch
3. Turn the laser off after each target is destroyed then slew shkval and lock onto new targert , the laser turns on when you fire Vikhr (Vikhr turns off laser after set time by itself, but this takes to long).


## HUD color

(`Right Ctrl` + `H`) changes the color of your hud to : Red,Green,Orange,Yellow
Brightness of HUD's color changed with (`Right Ctrl` + `H`) also.
Below are two example :

## Su-25T Pylons

The modeling of lateral and longitudinal center of mass is taken into effect. This can
change depending on fuel load and weapon loads.

The asymmetrical loading of weapon and fuel pylons, which influence the characteristics of
lateral control (depending on flight speed, regular overload, etc), is also modeled.
