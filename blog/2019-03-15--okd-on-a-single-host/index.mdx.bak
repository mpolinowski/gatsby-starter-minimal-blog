## Preparations

As this is a local test setup running on a small mini computer - comparable to an Intel NUC - we first have to make sure that it is reachable over the internet. For this we first have to [forward the ports](https://wiki.instar.com/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding/) __80, 443 and 8443__ inside our router:

If you already have a domain pointing to your [WAN IP Address](https://www.wieistmeineip.de) you can use this during the now following setup process when asked for a domain name. In my case I did not have one set up so I used the recommended [nip.io service](https://nip.io) - prefix the _nip.io_ with your [WAN IP](https://www.wieistmeineip.de) like __189.173.123.12.nip.io__ and this URL will automagically point to your WAN IP and you can later access the OKD interface via _https://console.189.173.123.12.nip.io:8443/_


## Installation Script

Now start with the [install script by gshipley](https://github.com/mpolinowski/installcentos) to install Origin Kubernetes on an CentOS 7 server:


1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gshipley/installcentos.git
```


2. Execute the installation script

```
cd installcentos
./install-openshift.sh
```
